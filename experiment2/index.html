				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This is a visual representation of the flow of resources from each faction to another in a game of Sidereal Confluence (board game). In this trading game, there is quite a lot of resource transfers, so I thought it would be interesting to represent this visually.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>I manually tracked the trades in a 4p solo game of Sidereal Confluence. I then was able to parse this information, turning each trade into a line object, and adding them all to an array. The slider allows you to determine how much of the array you want to look through and the number on the left top depicts the current round of the game.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>There were some issues in drawing the lines. They did not draw like I wanted them to, but at a certain point they were more interesting if I left them as is and so I stopped working on them. Another issue was data collection where I thought I collected enough data the first time but after talking to Wes I realized I could make the project display more information which would require me to take another 2 hours to record the data.</p>
